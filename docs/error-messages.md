Validator Error Messages
========================

The following tables list the validator error messages by type and message ID. Base DITA validator rules are in normal text. Rules in **bold** are examples of custom rules which can be detected if the `overrides` transform from the [Extended DITA Validator](https://github.com/jason-fox/com.here.validate.svrl.overrides) is used.

| **YES** |codeblock-outputclass-missing|Always provide an outputclass attribute in `<codeblock>` elements \(for example, add outputclass="language-javascript"\).|This `outputclass` attribute is used for decorating the HTML output to make code easier to read. If the content in the `<codeblock>` element is JSON use the key value pair `outputclass="language-javascript"`. For more information on the `<codeblock>` element, see [codeblock](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/codeblock.html).|
| **YES** |codeblock-scale-missing|Always provide a scale attribute in `<codeblock>` elements \(for example, add `scale="80"`\).|This `scale` attribute reduces the size of the code text in the output to make it easier to read \(the values are percent\). We recommend you set the scale to 80 percent. For more information on the `<codeblock>` element, see [codeblock](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/codeblock.html).|
| **YES** |conref-not-lower-case|The specification of `conref="..."` is invalid, allowed characters are: lower case, a-z only, words separated by hyphens.| The `conref` attribute is used for importing documentation segements reused across the document when the validator builds the document. For more information on using the `conref` attribute, see [conref](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/conref.html). When you get this error, the source file specified in the `conref` attribute references a file with an invalid name. For instance, if you define the `conref` attribute as follows `<p conref="<InvalidFileName>#invalid-file-name/submission-note">` the file name does not comply with the file naming guidelines.	- Only use lower case letters in a file name. - If a file name contains multiple words, use a hyphen to separate them, for example, `overview-map.dita` or `request-map-report.dita`. - The file type \(and file extension\) for all DITA XML files in the repository must be *.dita* or *.ditamap*. - Base the file name on the main topic title. If the title is `Naming Conventions` then the topic `id` should be `naming-conventions` and the file name should be `naming-conventions.dita`. - Do not include arbitrary strings to indicate the contents of the chapter, topic type, etc. - Do not include computer-generated text such as `topic-2` or `GUID-1234-5678-1234`. - Do not use non-standard acronyms, for instance, `border-xing` instead of `border-crossing`.	 |
| **NO** |**element-blacklisted**|**The `<name>` element is not compliant with our subset of DITA documentation standards.**|**Custom Rule**: While the DITA open standard supports a large number of elements, the extended validator only supports a subset of these elements in order to make the documents more consistent. Replace the rejected element with a supported element.|
| **YES** |fig-id-invalid|`id` values must start with `'fig-'` in all `<fig>` elements.|In order to assist with search engine optimization \(SEO\) of content, all [figure](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/fig.html) elements must have an `id`.|
| **NO** |fig-id-missing|Always provide an `id` value in `<fig>` elements.|In order to assist with search engine optimization \(SEO\) of content, all [figure](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/fig.html) elements must have an `id`.|
| **YES** |file-not-lower-case|Found file `'...'` with invalid name, allowed characters in file names are: lowercase, a-z only, words separated by hyphens.|In order to assist with search engine optimization \(SEO\) of content, file names must be lower case. Fix the name as appropriate.|
| **YES** |href-not-lower-case|The value provided in `href="..."` is invalid, allowed characters are: lowercase, a-z only, words separated by hyphens.|The file specified in the `href` attribute does not comply with the file naming conventions. Fix the name as appropriate.|
| **NO** |**id-blacklisted**|**`id` attribute values must not use the word `'content'`. Change the `id` value.**| **Custom Rule**: Some delivery channels used to deliver content to customers may be configured to already use certain `id` values. Change the word content to another `id`. For more information on `id` attributes, see [id](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/id.html).|
| **YES** |id-not-lower-case|The ID value in `id="..."` is invalid, allowed characters are: lowercase, a-z only, words separated by hyphens.|In order to assist with search engine optimization \(SEO\) of content, `id` attributes must comply with the `id` conventions. Fix the name as appropriate.	- Only use lower case letters in a file name. - If a file name contains multiple words, use a hyphen to separate them, for example, `overview-map.dita` or `request-map-report.dita`. - The file type \(and file extension\) for all DITA XML files in the repository must be *.dita* or *.ditamap*. - Base the file name on the main topic title. If the title is `Naming Conventions` then the topic ID should be `naming-conventions` and the file name should be `naming-conventions.dita`. - Do not include arbitrary strings to indicate the contents of the chapter, topic type, etc. - Do not include computer-generated text such as `topic-2` or `GUID-1234-5678-1234`.	For more information on `id` atrributes, see [id](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/id.html).|
| **NO** |image-file-type-not-supported|The value provided in `href="..."` specifies an unsupported file format \(only \*.jpg, \*.jpeg or \*.png are allowed\). Change the format of the linked file.|The validator ensures that only \*.jpg, \*.jpeg or \*.png format files are used in online HTML documents. Convert the image format to the correct format.|
| **NO** |section-id-missing|Always provide an `id` attribute in `<section>` elements.|In order to assist with search engine optimization \(SEO\), all [section](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/section.html) elements must have an `id`.||table-id-invalid|`id` values must start with 'table-' in `<table>` elements.|If you add an `id` to a table, start the `id` with the word 'table-'. For more information on tables, see [table](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/table.html).|
| **NO** |table-id-missing|Always provide an `id` attribute in `<table>` elements.|In order to assist with search engine optimization \(SEO\), add an `id` to `<table>` elements. For more information on tables, see [table](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/table.html).|
| **YES** |topic-file-mismatch|The value specified in id="\{name\}" does not match the file name: \{file\_name\}. Make sure the `id` value and the file name are the same.|In order to assist with search engine optimization \(SEO\) of content, the `id` for `<topic>` elements must be the same as the file name, which also ends up by the name of the HTML file. For more information on topics, see [topic](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/topic.html). For more information on element 'id`s', see [id](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/id.html).|
| **YES** |xref-no-format|Always provide a format attribute in `<xref>` elements, \(for example, format="dita" or format="html"\).|Specify a value for the `format` attribute for `<xref>` elements. Examples of valid values include `dita`, `html`, and `pdf`. For more information on `<xref>` elements, see [xref](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/xref.html).|

Structure Validation
--------------------

|Fix|Message ID|Message|Corrective Action/Comment|
|---|----------|-------|-------------------------|
| **NO** |chapter-href-missing|Always provide an href attribute in `<chapter>` elements.|When you add a `<chapter>` element to a `ditamap`, you must specify a `href="{file_name}"` key/value pair that defines the content that appears on the chapter page in the PDF \(and on the chapter landing page in HTML\). Alternatively, you can define the following two attributes: `navtitle="..." lockitle="yes"`. This approach has the effect of adding a title but not content on the chapter page/node. For more information on the `<chapter>` element, see [chapter](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/chapter.html).|
| **NO** |coderef-href-ref-file-not-found|The linked source file does not exist. Check the related folder for the missing file and make sure the file name is correct.|The `<coderef>` element is generally used for importing a source file when the validator builds the document. When you get this error, the reference cannot be resolved. Note that DITA does not allow you to reference files outside the root folder of the document. By default, these files should be in the `source` folder under the document root folder. For more information on the `<coderef>` element, see [codeblock](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/codeblock.html).|
| **NO** |colspec-colnum-not-unique|The key/value pair `colnum="..."` is not unique. Make sure there are no duplicates.|In order for the validator to render table content properly, these key/value pairs must be unique. For instance, the following codeblock illustrates well-formated DITA that complies with this requirement. `<colspec colnum="1"/><colspec colnum="2"/><colspec colnum="3"/>` For more information on the `<table>` element, see [table](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/table.html).|
| **NO** |conref-external-file-not-found|The linked file does not exist. Check the related folder for the missing file and make sure the file name is correct.| The `conref` attribute is used for importing documentation segements reused across the document when the validator builds the document. For more information on using the `conref` attribute, see [conref](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/conref.html). When you get this error, the referenced file cannot be resolved. Note that DITA does not allow you to reference files outside the root folder of the document. By default, this kind of content should be in the `includes.dita` file. |
| **NO** |conref-external-id-mismatch|The conref source `<{name}>` and the destination `<{name}>` are not the same type. Check to make sure the referenced elements are the same.| The `conref` attribute is used for importing documentation segements reused across the document when the validator builds the document. For more information on using the `conref` attribute, see [conref](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/conref.html). When you get this error, the referenced `id` in the source file specified in the `conref` attribute is an `id` for an element that is of a different type than the element with the `conref` attribute. DITA requires that `conref` attributes point at the same kind of element. For instance, `<p conref="includes.dita#includes/submission-note">` needs to reference an element in the `includes.dita` file that is formatted as follows `<p id="submission-note">CONTENT</p>`. |
| **NO** |conref-external-id-not-found|The referenced `id` does not exist in the source file. Make sure the ID value specified is correct.| The `conref` attribute is used for importing documentation segements reused across the document when the validator builds the document. For more information on using the `conref` attribute, see [conref](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/conref.html). When you get this error, the referenced `id` in the source file specified in the `conref` attribute cannot be resolved. For instance, if you define the `conref` attribute as follows `<p conref="includes.dita#includes/submission-note">` and you get this error, then the `includes.dita` file does not have a `<p>` whose `id` is set to `id="submission-note"`. |
| **NO** |conref-external-path-not-found|The referenced path does not exist. Make sure the path is correct.| The `conref` attribute is used for importing documentation segements reused across the document when the validator builds the document. For more information on using the `conref` attribute, see [conref](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/conref.html). When you get this error, the source file specified in the `conref` attribute cannot be resolved. For instance, if you define the `conref` attribute as follows `<p conref="includes.dita#includes/submission-note">` and you get this error, then the validator cannot find the `includes.dita` file. Note that DITA does not allow you to reference files outside the root folder of the document. |
| **NO** |conref-external-path-mismatch|The conref source <\{name\}\> and the destination <\{name\}\> are not the same type. Make sure the path is correct.| The `conref` attribute is used for importing documentation segements reused across the document when the validator builds the document. For more information on using the `conref` attribute, see [conref](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/conref.html). When you get this error, the referenced `id` in the source file specified in the `conref` attribute is an `id` for an element that is of a different type than the element with the `conref` attribute. DITA requires that `conref` attributes point at the same kind of element. For instance, `<p conref="includes.dita#includes/submission-note">` needs to reference an element in the `includes.dita` file that is formatted as follows `<p id="submission-note">CONTENT</p>`. |
| **NO** |conref-internal-id-not-found|The referenced `id` does not exist in this file. Make sure the `id` value specified is correct.| The `conref` attribute is used for importing documentation segements reused across the document when the validator builds the document. For more information on using the `conref` attribute, see [conref](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/conref.html). When you get this error, the referenced `id` specified in the `conref` attribute cannot be resolved. For instance, if you define the `conref` attribute as follows `<p conref="submission-note">` and you get this error, then the source file does not have a `<p>` whose `id` is set to `id="submission-note"`. |
| **NO** |conref-internal-path-mismatch|The conref source <\{name\}\> and the destination <\{name\}\> are not the same type. Make sure the path is correct.| The `conref` attribute is used for importing documentation segements reused across the document when the validator builds the document.

For more information on using the `conref` attribute, see [conref](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/conref.html). When you get this error, the value specified in the `conref` attribute cannot be resolved. For instance, if you define the `conref` attribute as follows `<p conref="<file_name>#submission-note">` and you get this error, then the validator cannot resolve the path. |
| **NO** |href-file-not-found|The file specified in `href="..."` does not exist. Check the related folder for the missing file and make sure the file name is correct.|The validator cannot find the file specified in the `href` attribute. Make sure the file is in the indicated path. Note that DITA does not allow you to reference files outside the root folder of the document.|
| **NO** |id-not-unique|Found a duplicate ID with value '\{name\}', `id` values must be unique within a file. Change the `id` value.|DITA requires that all `id`s within a file must be unique. Change the `id` value. For more information on `id` attributes, see [id](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/id.html).|
| **NO** |image-href-ref-file-not-found|The linked image file does not exist. Check the graphics folder for the missing file and make sure the link and file name specified are correct.|The validator cannot find the file specified in the `href` attribute. Check the path to ensure the file is there.|
| **NO** |**image-product-filtered-not-included**|**Found `<image product="...">`. This results in an empty `<fig>` for other variants. Add additional `product` attributes for the missing ditaval filters.**|**Custom Rule**: When skinning a document for various customers it is necessary to filter the images used. By placing all images in a single conref'd file it is easier to ensure that all images will be present for all customers. see [ditavals](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/common/about-ditaval.html).|
| **NO** |list-all-li-filtered|Found only `<li product="...">` elements in `<ul>`. This results in an empty `<ul>` for other variants. Either add additional `product` attributes for the ditaval filters or add `<ul product="..."\>` to the appropriate list elements.|The specified variant creation attributes result in a variant with a list without list items. Specify an additional variant attribute to ensure the list has items in all variants or remove the list entirely by specifiying the appropriate attributes. For more information on creating variants, see [ditavals](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/common/about-ditaval.html). For information on list items, see [li](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/langref/li.html).|
| **NO** |table-all-rows-filtered| Found only `<row product="..."\>` elements in `<tbody\>`.	This results in an empty `<tbody>` for other variants. Either add additional product attributes for the missing variants or add `<table product="..."\>` to the appropriate elements. The specified variant creation attributes result in a variant with a table without rows, which results in a broken PDF build.	| Specify an additional variant attribute to ensure the table has rows in all variants or remove the table entirely by specifiying the appropriate attributes. For more information on creating variants, see [ditavals](http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/common/about-ditaval.html).
